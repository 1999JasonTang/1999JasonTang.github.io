# Hello there,
My name is Jason Tang, a first year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto - St. George Campus. 

# What I do
Aside from schoolwork and studying, I spend a lot of time learning programming languages and skills through side projects, such as this website. To see more of my projects, here's a link to my <a href="https://www.github.com/MildlySpicy" style="color:#00B0FF" >Github</a>.

Additionally, I also work part time as a private tutor to help somewhat alleviate the immense student debt I have. If you're curious here's the company's <a href="https://www.goodstudytutoring.com" style="color:#00B0FF" >site</a>.

For other things I do in my spare time, check <a href="/hobbies" style="color:#00B0FF" >this</a> out.
