# Hello there,
My name is Jason Tang, I am a first year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto - St. George Campus. 

# What I do
Aside from academia, I take pleasure in learning programming languages through side projects, such as this website. To see more of my projects, check out my <a href="https://www.github.com/MildlySpicy" style="color:#00B0FF" target="_blank">Github</a>.

I also work part time as a private tutor to help somewhat alleviate the immense student debt I have. If you're curious here's the company's <a href="https://www.goodstudytutoring.com" style="color:#00B0FF" target="_blank">site</a>.
